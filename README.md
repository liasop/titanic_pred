# titanic_pred

### This notebook performs data engineering on the titanic survival Data Set, and uses a decision tree to predict survival
this implementation also uses cross validation to avoid overfitting

### What sorts of people were more likely to survive?
first class passengers, women, kids under the age of 12, people who purchased more expensive tickets, and people with fewer family members on board were more likely to survive. This is determined by examining the nodes of the decision trees.
